## Directions:

This assignment is designed to guide you in understanding the foundational aspects of your project. Remember, in software engineering, understanding the "why" behind decisions is often as important as the decisions themselves. As you navigate these early stages of your coding journey, focus on grasping the core reasons behind each choice, and use this document to record and reflect on those reasons.

## 3. Technical Choices

### 3.1. Frontend Framework

**Choice:** HTML and CSS

### 3.2. Backend Framework

**Choice:** JavaScript 

### 3.3. Database System

We chose MySQL as a database management system due to its reliability and extensive features.  It also offers robust data storage and retrieval capabilities which is very useful for the Ares web app.

## 4. Other Considerations

### 4.1. Team Skills and Learning

We are all new to learning CSS and HTML so we are excited to learn it and put it to use. We all have some experience with MySQL and JavaScript. 

### 4.2. Community and Support

HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL have extensive documentation and community support which makes it easy to find resources and solutions to common problems. This availaility of resources ensures smooth development and troubleshooting processes. 

### 4.3. Future Adaptability

While HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL provide a strightforward solution for the current project requirements, the simplicity of the chosen technology also allows for future adaptability. If the project requirements were to evolve or expand, additional technologies or frameworks can be integrated as needed.
