UNLIKE other endless runner games, OUR PRODUCT offers a unique blend of intuitive swipe controls and simple, yet addictive, ensuring each run is a captivating adventure that keeps players coming back for more.

## Learning and Growth Journey

 - Braillee - we really struggled to communicate in this class and our problems were only worsened by Christian leaving thankfully we were able to come together at the end try and get something together.

 - Haiman - We had to learn to overcome our Plan A idea later in the semester and come up with a whole new project and make it functional in a very short amount of time. We had a better approach on the second project.

- Bianca - One of our toughest challenges was communication but we were able to overcome it.  We were also hit with another challenge of having to completely switch project ideas.  However, we were able to push through and I think we did a good job of that.  I also think we were able to better navigate through the issues we were having the first couple weeks of class. 

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   - We were unsuccessful in using Trello and teams to try and communicate with other the only thing that really even gave us any hope was discord and we were able to use it to communicate and share files.

2. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   - unfortunately our idea became impossible once I realized that the insight rover which we were going to get our info from was no longer functional unfortunately I did not realize this until I actually tried to call info from the api.

3. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   - Braillee - I was able to create the menu and get a character icon working as well as compiling the game into an executable .jar file
   - Haiman - Came up with the idea for the new project and was able to create the whole base endless runner game in Java that we later added many features to. Kept the team focused.
   -Bianca - Acting as scribe and submitting assignments after collaborating on answers with team members.

4. **Learning and Growth:**
   - I wasn't in class much but my group convinced to at least turn something I'm glad I did, they pushed to do more and I really appreciate that as a person that often doesn't like to ask for help I felt I could at least rely on them a bit.

   - Haiman - Trying to get a software finished under pressure and with little time was definitely a learning curve, but I'm grateful that we were able to come together as a team with improved communication and get the game functioning and presentable in a timely manner.

- Bianca - I feel like we had a really tough time during the first couple weeks of class trying to communicate and I think losing a team member did not help that either.  However, I am impressed by how well we were able to eventually come together and figure out a way to handle the issues we were having.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

- We spend enough time mindlessly scrolling through our phones how about instead you play a simple game that will waste your time but at least won't steal your data.

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** When you die in the game, a menu shows up with different keys you can tap to command the game what to do next. For example: 'Q' to quit, 'R' to restart, SPACE to restart.
- **Example 2:** We keep track of your high score so you can brag to your friends that you are better than them.

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** The app calls the show menu operator and pulls up a small menu which shows you your score, high score, and asks if you would like to restart or quit.

### Codebase Exploration

- **Example:** We track your high score a text file hat updates every time that your current score goes above the previous high score

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** Provide access to your source code repository.
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation

-Braillee - I have much to learn about managing a team and working on an important project in group and if I could go back I would tell myself that my original idea was doomed from the beginning 

-Haiman - I feel like I did a good job transitioning my team and keeping them focused on a whole new project. I pushed my team to help bug fix and add features to my base endless runner project that was created in such a short amount of time. I appreciate their work on it because without them I would not have a functioning game with the features I wanted. This taught me that having a team with different roles and mindsets is critical when creating a functioning software.

-Bianca - After taking this class, I agree with what Braillee said, I have also learned a lot about managing a team. I have also learned a lot about how to deal when your team may be having issues such as communication. Even though we did struggle, we were all willing to get through and motivate each other to get this final project done.  I am very appreciative of how our team was able to come together at the end and I am also grateful for their help and different skill sets that were needed to get this project done.  

- **Duration:** 25-minute minimum, 40-minute maximum

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:** Reflect on a time when coordinating with team members improved a project's outcome or efficiency.
 - Braillee - We unfortunately did not collaborate that well together 

 - Haiman - For the most part we did not collaborate very well given that we lost a team member. Towards the end we started to come together after I proposed a new idea and executed on it.

- Bianca - For most of the semester, we had a very difficult time collaborating due to differences in schedules and losing a team memeber.  We were eventually able to figure out a good rhythm and got the project done.  Haiman came up with the new idea and we all decided how we were going to go about it. We were able to do this very well. 

2. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.
 - Braillee - There was a while that the game as increasing the score by 42 instead of 1 and then crashing but this was because of a faulty for loop 

 - Haiman - There was an issue where the menu on the gameover screen wasn't working when pressing certain keys like 'R' to restart wouldn't restart and instead do nonthing. This was caused by an incorrect keyPressed method.

3. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.
 - Braillee - I created the menu and made it translucent.

- Bianca - We would all discuss our answers to the assisngmnets and I offered to be the scribe and create the markdown files as well as submit them.

 - Haiman - Proposed the new idea for the project after the first one was not going to work and created the whole functioning base endless runner game in java with some features like random cloud rendering and a skyline in the background that also gives off the impression of being in motion. The game also loops when you die and keeps trakc of your score and high score. Changed layout of menus and start/game over screens as well as the base game many times.
4. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.
 - Braillee - 
 - Haiman - Learning about the different types of ide's I should use after asking the professor. This allowed me to choose the appropriate ide for the game I was going to create.
- Bianca - Getting introduced to Visual Studio Code, which was very helpful and something I will be using a lot after taking this class. 

5. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.
 - Braillee - Well we had to completely pivot with our whole plan and I think we did a decent job given ome of our restrictions
 - Haiman - We had to come up with a whole new software to create in a short time span after realizing that our first one was not going to work.
- Bianca - We faced many challenges this semester, but the biggest one was having to come up with a  completely new idea for our project.  We were able to overcome it by buckling down and collaborating. Even though it was a challenge that we probbaly did not want to have to deal with, it ws one that really forced us to all come together to better our communicaiton and collaboration skills.
