# Endless Runner Game 
Led a team of four in my Software Engineering capstone project at Rhode Island College (RIC) to develop a Java-based endless runner game. Designed features like menus, pause functionality, dynamic obstacles, & scoring systems. Used Agile & Scrum methodologies with GitHub & Trello for project management, earning commendations at the RIC  showcase.
